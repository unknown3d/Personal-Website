Also an events officer for the Singapore Students Society on the 2021/2022 committee.\n\nTrinity College Foundation Studies\n\n\n\n\n2018:\nTransferred to Trinity College for my final year of high school. I took electives Mathematics 1, Mathematics 2 and Accounting. The choice of these electives were made with the intent of meeting the requirements for the bachelor of commerce at the University of Melbourne\n\nWesley College Glen Waverley\n\n\n\n\n2013 - 2017:\nI attended Wesley College after moving over to Australia from Singapore. Here I was exposed to a new approach and philosophy towards studying and learning, with an emphasis on being self driven and being resourceful in how to find information.\n\n\nNational Service\n\n\n\n\n2019 - 2021:\nAfter high school I returned to Singpore to complete my 2 years of national service. I was enlisted into the Police force and completed the Police Officers Basic Training before being posted to the Protective Security Command. There I commissioned as an Insitu-Reaction Team (IRT) Trooper after completing additional training. The IRT was first introduced in December 2017 as a quick reaction force on the ground geared towards neutralising armed threats. High-visibility foot patrols are conducted at locations with high human traffic, deterring any potential attacks by projecting a strong police presence in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
