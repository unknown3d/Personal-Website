```
After completing Basic Training I was posted to the Protective Security Command. There I commissioned as an Insitu-Reaction Team (IRT) Trooper after completing additional training. The IRT was first introduced in December 2017 as a quick reaction force on the ground geared towards neutralising armed threats. High-visibility foot patrols are conducted at locations with high human traffic, deterring any potential attacks by projecting a strong police presence in the area.
