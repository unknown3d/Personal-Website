2019 - 2021:  
After high school I returned to Singpore to complete my 2 years of national service. I was enlisted into the Police force and completed the Police Officers Basic Training before being posted to the Protective Security Command. There I commissioned as an Insitu-Reaction Team (IRT) Trooper after completing additional training. The IRT was first introduced in December 2017 as a quick reaction force on the ground geared towards neutralising armed threats. High-visibility foot patrols are conducted at locations with high human traffic, deterring any potential attacks by projecting a strong police presence in the area.
